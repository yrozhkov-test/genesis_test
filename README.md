# genesis_test
Check task for Genesis DevOps School

We had a task in which it was said that there was a ready-made Linux machine with a ready-to-use Docker and Docker Compose (https://github.com/amomama/devops-school/issues/3)
So, if we say about one-command runner, we need to put .yml file from this repository to local machine, choose local dir with this file in terminal and exec command 
```
docker-compose up
```
After this we can open in browser this path 
```
http://localhost:8080/
```
and start working with WordPress on clean, new page.
